core:
  - Addr, Port could probably be merged in server
  - Support for socks5
  - Actual chaining
  - Warn / deny people if they run a socks4a listener (supports no auth) and socks5 with auth
  - Document that socks4 userids are not supported
  - Actually might drop socks4 listening in general, who the hell uses that still?

log:
  - loggers should wrap an io.Writer
  - stdout / stderr by default
  - multiplexer
  - log levels?

config:
  - validation / etc should be done with UnmarshalJSON override
  - authentication

tests:
  - write them
